=Sample RIA: Adobe Flex Store=

http://flexcairngorm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/samples/FlexStore.gif

== Introduction ==

The Macromedia !FlexBuilder 2 installer provided (to the Flex developers) a sample application called the *Flex Store*.

The !FlexStore was provided to the community to demonstrate rich-client application concepts that could be created using tiles, filters, effects, transitions, view states, etc. The !FlexStore provides 3 screens of content: Home, Products, Support. The Products screen dynamically loads an xml catalog file for mobile phones. In the Product screen, users can interactively:
  * filter which phones are displayed by criteria of cost, features, and other options. 
  * compare features of 1 or more phones
  * add/remove phones from the shopping cart
  * drag 'n drop phones to the compare or shopping cart areas. 

== Issues ==

The !FlexStore is quite amazing in the plethora of features and techniques that it demonstrates in a sample application. 

Unfortunately the !FlexStore suffers from *4 significant* problems:
  * The code is poor organized and hard to maintain.
  * Business logic is mixed with view logic and view code.
  * Access to remote data services is mixed with view code.
  * View components are not using events properly and are badly _coupled_. 

With these considerations, it becomes obvious that the !FlexStore is *not* an example of code that would be used to create a production or enterprise application. This application (in its original state) would be a _nightmare_ to enhance or reuse. 

== Solution ==

The !FlexStore application desperately needed the Cairngorm MVC framework. Below are links to the modified versions of the !FlexStore. 

Developers will notice that the runtime !UI has not changed at all. Only the code _under the hood_ has changed. Component relationships, use of events, and code partitioning have all been significant improved. Developers are encouraged to download all versions below and compare the changes.

Note: the above !FlexStore links include the !FlexBuilder project files. These project files require !FlexBuilder 3 and include the Cairngorm 2.2.1 flex library (.swc).
